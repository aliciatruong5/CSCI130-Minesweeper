# CSCI130-Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game genre generally played on personal computers. The game
features a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden "mines" (depicted as naval mines in the original game)
scattered throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with
help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
